# Welcome to the InnerSource SIG

<div className="frontPageContent">

<BoxOut image="/img/bok/page-types/what.png" title="What is it?" className='boxout1' link="/docs/InnerSource/Introduction" linkText="Find out More">

The FINOS InnerSource <a href="https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#special-interest-groups">Special Interest Group</a> is a community of people implementing, or interested in implementing, InnerSource within their financial services organization in order to increase collaboration and remove/deal with excessive ownership issues that can stall innovation.

It is likely of particular importance to financial services organisations who wish to accelerate their InnerSource practices, share best practices, patterns and anti-patterns and potentially related code in a secure environment in collaboration with others in similar positions.
InnerSource can help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration and
innovation, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to
contribute software back to the open source world.

Where appropriate, the InnerSource SIG will also work with
[InnerSource Commons](http://www.innersourcecommons.org) to share relevant
outputs upstream to the broader InnerSource community.

Discussions have an emphasis on challenges and concerns that are particular to
Financial Services organizations (e.g. relating to compliance or regulatory constraints).

The InnerSource SIG target audience are individuals responsible for InnerSource
implementation within financial services organizations, those in Open Source
Program Offices interested in open source culture, behaviour and skills, or tech
leaders wishing to increase collaboration and remove / deal with excessive
ownership issues that can stall innovation.
