    rules where stakeholders can provide feedback.
  - However this is not standardized across the organization and not all of the
    projects provide this info.

    homogeneous way to do this across the organization at the level of each
    InnerSource project.

    collective decision-making that the organization endorses.

    accessible during work processes.

### Helpful Resources
