An open source policy is a set of guidelines that outlines how an organization will consume, contribute to, and create open source software. It defines the rules that govern the use, distribution, and licensing of open source software within the organization. It establishes processes for evaluating open source software, managing the risks associated with its use, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements.

> Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.  ... Policy is a blueprint of the organizational activities which are repetitive/routine in nature. - [Policy, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy)

## Why is an Open Source Policy Needed?

Open source software has become an integral part of modern software development. It offers a cost-effective, flexible, and collaborative way to build software solutions. However, it also brings unique challenges that need to be addressed. Without a clear policy, organizations may be at risk of legal and security issues related to open source software use. An open source policy provides a framework for managing these risks and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements.

## What Will The Policy Cover?

 - **[Consuming Open Source Software:](../Activities/Level-2/Consumption-Compliance)** An open source policy should provide guidelines for evaluating and using open source software. For example, the policy should define the criteria for selecting open source software, such as its licensing terms, community support, and security. There are vendor tooling and suggested self administered maturity surveys to develop the scoring methods.The policy should also outline the process for assessing the risks associated with using open source software, such as identifying any vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements.

 - **[Contributing to Open Source Software:](../Activities/Level-3/Contribution-Compliance)**  An open source policy should also define the process for contributing to open source software. For example, the policy should outline the procedures for submitting contributions, such as code changes or bug fixes, to the open source community. The policy should also provide guidance on how to engage with the community, such as participating in forums, providing feedback, and collaborating with other contributors.

 - **[Open-Sourcing New/Internal Projects:](../Activities/Level-4/Open-Sourcing-A-Project)**  An open source policy should provide guidelines for creating new open source software projects. For example, the policy should define the licensing terms, the requirements for documenting the software, and the process for releasing it to the open source community. The policy should also outline the procedures for managing the software's development, such as defining the roles and responsibilities of contributors, and establishing quality control measures.

## How is an Open Source Policy Created?

Creating an open source policy involves several steps:

### 1. Identify the Goals and Objectives

Identify the goals and objectives of the open source policy. This includes determining how the policy will support the organization's mission and strategic objectives. This starts with defining a concise policy statement, why and how the company uses or contributes to open source software, and what benefits and risks are involved. Some example goals could be:

- "We use open source software when it is the best tool, taking into account open source and proprietary alternatives, cost, quality and ease of support."
- “We see open source software as a way to reduce IT costs”
- “We see open source software as a way to foster a culture of openness and collaboration within the company and with the broad open source community. We continue to encourage employees to use, create and contribute to open source software projects that do align with the business objectives and our values”

### 2. Determine the Scope

Determine the scope of the open source policy. This includes identifying the types of open source software that will be covered, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the different groups of stakeholders.

### 3. Obtain Buy-in and Approval

Obtain buy-in and approval from stakeholders, including executives, legal, security, and IT teams.  Consider talking to the following:

**See Also:**

 - [Creating An OSPO](../Activities/Level-2/Creating-An-OSPO) for tips about building consensus.

### 4. Address The Risks

Develop the policy by outlining the guidelines, rules, and best practices for consuming, contributing, and creating open source software. The policy should also define the processes for evaluating and approving open source software, managing risks, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical requirements. 

Risks suggested to contain mitigating the followings:

### 5. Consider Policy Intersections

The open source policy will intersect with other, existing policies, such as:

<BokTagList tag="Policy" filter="Regulations" />

### 6. Mandate Training

Staff will need to be trained on how to follow policy.
