Open source software may have hidden costs, such as maintenance, support, security, and compliance. Users and contributors need to be aware of the total cost of ownership and the implications of using different licenses.

Large amounts of code in a project slow down development and reduce developer effectiveness because complexity has to be _managed_.  The larger a codebase, the more bugs and vulnerabilities it will contain.

Using open source software can often reduce Codebase Risk since it hands off the maintainance of portions of the codebase to third parties.   However, this doesn't mean that using open source code is risk-free.  Codebase Risk in the form of vulnerabities and functional mismatch still exist.

**Example:** [Technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) refers to the cost of maintaining and updating existing code over time.

**Example:** The risk of owning too much code is commonly referred to as [Codebase Bloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_bloat). This occurs when a codebase becomes large and unwieldy, making it difficult to maintain, modify, or scale.
