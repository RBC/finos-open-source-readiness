Legal risk refers to the potential for an organization to face legal consequences and financial or reputational harm as a result of its actions or decisions that violate laws and regulations.

> [Basel II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II) classified legal risk as a subset of operational risk in 2003. This conception is based on a business perspective, recognizing that there are threats entailed in the business operating environment. The idea is that businesses do not operate in a vacuum and in the exploitation of opportunities and their engagement with other businesses, their activities tend to become subjects of legal liabilities and obligations. - [Legal Risk, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_risk)
