Within the Open Source Ecosystem, millions of projects exist and some of the projects are duplicate efforts.  The open source community is vast and sometimes very hard to reach.  

In order to have a wide-reaching, impactful project, it has to stand out.  Stand out not in the way where, I have an awesome project that is going to make an impact, but more along the line of - my project solves a problem and the project can be improved upon.  We want to ensure that there is longevity within a project. /

Before starting out in the initial project creation phase, here are some questions that you should think about: 

- Determine what your project could do for the for the community
- Is your project worth its weight on its own or could it be a feature enhancement to another larger project?
