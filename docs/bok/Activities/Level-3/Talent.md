Managing talent in financial institutions is crucial because the quality, motivation, and expertise of their workforce directly influence the institutions' ability to innovate, maintain a competitive edge, comply with regulatory requirements, and ultimately drive financial performance and growth.

**THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER**

## Attracting Talent

 - Sponsoring Events
 - Visibility in the open source space by contributing projects or engineering muscle

## Nurturing Talent
 
 - Train new and coach existing open source leaders 
 - Recognize contributions of organization's members
 - Create programs to incentivize contributions of organization's members
 - Drive an internal open source ambassadors program
 - Making it easy to contribute
 - Set up open source career paths

## Retaining Talent

 - Finance organisations are great at _attracting_ talent by simply paying very high wages.  The problem is attrition.  
 - It's important to understand that lots of open source is developed for _non-financial rewards_.   
 - If you hire a key engineer who is a top contributor to an open source project and then prevent them from contributing further then they will likely leave.
 - Even if you allow them to continue contributing, if the workflow is onerous (e.g. MD-level reviews of their code) they will also get fed up and leave.
 - To _retain_ these high-performing staff, you have to give them the right tools to carry on contributing effectively.
 - Also: GitHub is _becoming a CV_.
 - Ironically, hiring from a strategic open source project actually will reduce the value of that project if the employee isn't allowed to contribute back.  
 
 
## Proprietary Platforms

Developers don't want to work on your organisation's proprietary platform as their skills are not transferable and they are less productive (the ecosystem is smaller than with open source tools).   Using open source is a big attraction:

 - If you hire a key engineer who is a top contributor to an open source project then you are preventing them from contributing anymore.  They will leave.
 - Even if you allow them to continue contributing, but the workflow is onerous (e.g. MD-level reviews of their code) they will also get fed up and leave.
