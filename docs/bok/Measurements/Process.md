It is important to make sure that your organisation's staff are able to both _efficiently and compliantly_ contribute code to open source repositories.

The time it takes to push a first Pull Request to a new project. 

 i.e:

  - Project is internally approved for contribution
  - Developer is internally approved for contribution
