<BoxOut title="Line of Business" image="/img/bok/roles/business.png">

The Line of Business (LOB) within a bank refers to a distinct unit or department that focuses on specific products, services, or customer segments, contributing to the overall revenue generation and growth of the institution.

### Objectives

Using software and other technology to:

- Optimize operational efficiency
- Drive revenue
- Improve customer satisfaction.

### Challenges

- Competing priorities                  
- Organizational silos
- Skills gaps/lack of resources"
- Automation of compliance processes

### Open Source Awareness

- Learning/training programs on how to use open source
- Impact assessment of open source
- Show how to find and contribute “easy code” - low hanging products
- Produce case studies and metrics for open source success stories
- Find internal champions
- Explain the risks involved in not contributing

### Open Source Engagement

LOBs can benefit from cost savings, rapid development, and access to a wide range of cutting-edge tools and technologies, thereby enabling them to respond more effectively to market changes, competition, and evolving customer expectations. Having a clear policy for personal contributions is important to ensure contributors feel safe to contribute. Firm contributions are frustrated by risks/approvals so work to minimise this.

In addition, LOBs can contribute to open source projects, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation while demonstrating thought leadership and industry expertise. Produce metrics such as mean time to remediation or a maturity score for contributions.

### Internal Stakeholders

 - [Executive Leadership](CEO)
 - [IT Departments](Developer)
 - Project & [Product Managers](Product-Manager)
 - [Risk and Compliance Teams](Compliance)
 - [Human Resources](HR-Training)
 - Marketing and Sales / Communications
 - Persuasion can happen via the CIO/CTO or distinguished engineer community buy-in
