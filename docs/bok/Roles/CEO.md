<BoxOut title="Chief Executive Officer" image="/img/bok/roles/ceo.png">

The CEO, or Chief Executive Officer, is the highest-ranking executive in a company and is responsible for leading and overseeing its overall direction and operations. 

The CEO's primary role is to provide strategic vision, set goals, and make decisions that ensure the company's long-term success. They also have the crucial responsibility of building and maintaining relationships with stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, and partners.

### Objectives

Provide vision and guidance as well as to help manage relationships with key stakeholders, including the board of directors, employees, investors, customers and suppliers. The CEO must also be able to translate the companyâ€™s strategy into actionable goals for employees, who then execute those plans.

### Challenges

- Balancing board expections, customer expectations, and regulatory requirements  
           
- Uncertain economic growth
 
- Enterprise resiliency

### Open Source Engagement

A CEO should understand why the organisation is pursuing an OSS strategy in first place (e.g. whether to attract talent, as a product development strategy or to improve developer experience).

### Internal Stakeholders

Works closely with the entire C-Suite especially the Chief Operating Officer, and reports to the Board.
