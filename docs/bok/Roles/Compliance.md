<BoxOut title="Risk Officer / Compliance" image="/img/bok/roles/risk.png">

Although Risk and Compliance are separate roles within the bank, for the purposes of the body of knowledge we will be considering them a single concern.  However, it's worth understanding the difference:

- _Risk_ refers to the potential for loss, damage, or adverse outcomes arising from internal or external factors that may affect a bank's financial stability, operations, or reputation. Banks face various types of risks, including credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, and reputational risk. Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating these risks to maintain the bank's stability and protect its assets, customers, and shareholders. 

- _Compliance_ refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, rules, and standards that govern the banking industry. Banks must comply with a wide range of regulatory requirements imposed by government agencies, central banks, and other authorities to ensure the integrity, transparency, and fairness of the financial system. Compliance involves ensuring that a bank's operations, products, services, and personnel abide by these regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) rules, Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines, data privacy laws, and capital adequacy requirements.
