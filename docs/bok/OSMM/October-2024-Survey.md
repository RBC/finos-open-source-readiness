title: October 2024 OSFF Survey and Discussion
---

Over the course of 2024, the OSR SIG completed the [Checklist](Checklist) from the perspective of their own companies (13 results).  Here are the results of that survey.


## Per Level

![Per Level](/img/bok/maturity/survey-2024/per-level.png)

An interesting thing to note here is that _Contribution_ lags level 4.  This matches up empirically with the opinions of those present.  In 2024 contribution is a problem.

## Per Activity

At this level, we noted that [Building an Open Source Culture](/bok/Activities/Level-3/Culture), [Managing Open Source talent](/bok/Activities/Level-3/Talent), [Contributing a Firm Open Source Project](/bok/Activities/Level-4/Open-Sourcing-A-Project) and [Leveraging open Source As A Strategy](/bok/Activities/Level-5/Leveraging-Strategically) were rated lower than other activities.

## Discussion

At a round table in October 2024, members of the FINOS community discussed the results.  Since the meeting was Chatham House Rule, the transcript can't be published, however here are some abridged notes of the points raised:

1. **Variability in Maturity and Capabilities Across Organizations:**
   - Banks and large institutions differ significantly in their open-source maturity. 
   - Some divisions excel in open-source contributions, while others lag (e.g., "level four or five" vs. "zeros and ones").

2. **Challenges with Scale and Engineering Quality:**
   - Managing open-source initiatives at scale (e.g., 30,000 engineers vs. 2,000 engineers) introduces unique challenges.
   - Metrics like code quality, productivity, and open-source contributions (e.g., using tools like Blue Optima) can help identify high-performing teams.

3. **Industry Benchmarks and Surveying:**
   - Thereâ€™s value in benchmarking open-source engagement across industries beyond banking, such as blockchain and fintech.
   - Randomized surveys could provide more balanced data but face logistical challenges.

4. **Emerging Metrics and Leadership Buy-In:**
   - Metrics like contribution frequency, quality testing, and engagement are vital to measure success.
   - Open-source maturity checklists evolved from a self-assessment tool into a competitive benchmarking system.

5. **Leadership and Governance:**
   - To promote open-source participation, leadership must see tangible business benefits.
   - Governance structures (e.g., software radars or tracking tools) are essential for oversight and risk management.

6. **Value of Open-Source in Decision-Making:**
   - Open-source metrics inform strategic decisions at a business level, driving priorities like testing, quality assurance, and reduced production rollback rates.
   - Leaders need a tailored narrative to align open-source goals with business objectives.

7. **Broader Ecosystem Considerations:**
   - Beyond traditional financial services, industries with developer-centric cultures (e.g., blockchain) may approach open-source differently.
   - Exploring the interplay between internal processes (e.g., inner-source adoption) and external open-source contributions could be beneficial.

8. **Resource Constraints and Individual Contributions:**
   - Many organizations still rely on limited resources or even singular contributors for critical open-source projects.
   - This highlights the need for sustainable funding and broader participation.

9. **Decision-Making Frameworks:**
   - Effective open-source strategies require alignment from top leadership down to the engineering teams.
   - Examples include developer experience investment, structured documentation, and embedding open-source in the organizational culture.

10. **Governance and Risk Management:**
    - Without oversight, organizations risk exposure to unknown dependencies or security vulnerabilities.
    - Governance frameworks are vital for visibility into the software supply chain.

1. **Developer Advocacy and Community Support**: Inner source projects are distinguished from regular internal projects by their open and collaborative nature, emphasizing the importance of visibility, advocacy, and community involvement.

2. **Technical Infrastructure for Inner Source**: Examples of tools like Backstage.io were discussed as strategic portals for cataloging and discovering inner source projects. Integrating repositories like GitLab or Bitbucket with centralized platforms was seen as vital for visibility and engagement.

3. **Organizational Challenges**: Challenges related to maintaining focus on inner source in resource-constrained environments were highlighted, with suggestions like creating an incubator or assigning accountable roles to ensure continuity despite shifting priorities.

4. **Cross-Divisional Collaboration**: The difficulties in achieving cross-divisional inner source adoption, especially when organizational silos and shifting focus can disrupt projects, were noted. Governance models and mature inner source ecosystems were proposed to mitigate these issues.

5. **Criteria for Inner Source Designation**: Strict criteria for "official" inner source projects were discussed, such as contributions from multiple business units and meeting certain maturity standards to ensure reliability and prevent disruptions.

6. **Global Complexities**: Differences in global operations, including tax implications for cross-border contributions and varied priorities across geographical divisions, add layers of complexity to inner source implementation.

7. **Encouraging Discovery and Contribution**: Participants explored mechanisms to make it easier for developers to discover and contribute to inner source projects, suggesting unified views of projects with associated metrics like language, division, and impact.

8. **Metrics and Recognition**: Recognizing and measuring the success of inner source projects, such as tracking forks, contributions, and other quantitative metrics, was highlighted as a way to demonstrate value and secure support.

9. **Management Engagement and Advocacy**: The need to engage managers and align their goals with the benefits of inner source was reiterated, noting that while developers are often eager to participate, managerial support is crucial for sustained involvement.

10. **Sustainability and Accountability**: Establishing formal governance and accountability for inner source projects, akin to open source foundations, was proposed as a way to address risks, ensure maintenance, and manage cross-organizational dependencies effectively.

The discussion concluded with reflections on the strategic importance of inner source, the shared understanding that it involves organizational change management, and the need for tools, governance, and advocacy to ensure its success.
