This module covers the basic elements of open source, and serves as one of the building blocks within the ‘Strategy & Governance’ section of the open source framework. Understanding these elements is critical to explaining both the importance of open source in today’s business landscape as well as for building the foundation for more advanced learning. Being able to effectively articulate and utilize these basic concepts within open source gives learners a strong base from which to participate in important discussions and help make informed decisions for their organization.
