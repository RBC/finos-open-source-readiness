<BoxOut title="Cross Border Obligations" image="/img/bok/regs/cross-border.png">

Many organisations are bound by what is allowed to cross their borders.  For example:  in Swiss banks, there are strong controls in place to make sure no data leaves Switzerland.   This is a consideration for code too, as code _contributed to GitHub_ is data leaving the organisation and there may be requirements around these obligations.

## Intersection With Open Source

- **Cross Border Data Clearance (CBDC)**:  Only really applies to data.  Not source code.   Public source doesn't apply.  Working groups don't apply.  Use of data classified as [public](../Artifacts/IP#information-classification).  Not banning data, but asking "is this public?".  

### Controls

- Screen out (via [Code Review](../Activities/Level-3/Publication)) contributions containing _data_ (including what might be regarded as "test data") and only allow code-only. This is another example of why preventing contributions with "test data" in them may be good policy.
